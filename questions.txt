Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

-forEach() calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array in ascending order. It is not invoked for index properties that have been deleted or are uninitialized.

-map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

-forEach changes the current array and map() gives you a new array

What is the difference between a function and a method?

-A method is a piece of code that is called by name that is associated with an object
-A function is a piece of code that is called by name and it can be passed data and return data

-class Car {
// function all of it 
  constructor(model, milesPerGallon) {
    
   // this is method
    this.model = model;
    this.milesPerGallon = milesPerGallon;
    this.tank = 0;
    this.odometer = 0;
  }

What is closure?
-function with in a function 

Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
-1. Window Binding - if none of the other rules apply "this" defaults to the window - unless you are in strict mode in which case it returns undefined 
2.  Implicit Binding 
//most common rule - found in 80% of use cases
// when the function is invoked - look to the left of the dot - that is what "this" refers to
// only applies to objects with methods
  3. Explicit Binding 
// Call - will immediately invoke the function / .call you pass in arguments 1 by 1
// Apply - will immediately invoke the function / .apply you pass in arguments as an array
// Bind - you pass in arguments 1 by 1 but it does not immediately invoke the function. It returns a brand new function that can be invoked later
// all of the above allow us to explicitly state what the "this" keyword refers to.
  4. New Binding 
// using the new keyword constructs a new object and "this" points to it
// when a function is invoked as a constructor function using the new keyword "this" points to the new object that's created 


Why do we need super() in an extended class?
-thats what calls to the parent
